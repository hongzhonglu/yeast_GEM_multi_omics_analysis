SGA Analysis: Robotic Manipulation of Yeast Arrays 
The robotic manipulation of deletion mutant array (DMA) and SGA screens were 
carried out as described (S1). We conducted each SGA screen three times and scored the 
resultant double mutants for synthetic genetic interactions by both visual inspection and 
computer-based image analysis. The computer-based scoring generated an estimate of 
relative growth rates from the area of individual colonies, as measured from digital 
images of the growth plates. A comparison of a set of mutant measurements to wild-type 
control measurements enabled t-statistics and p-values to be calculated (S2).  For each 
screen, we generated both an unbiased set of putative interactions and a biased set of 
putative interactions.  The unbiased set included double mutants that appeared to form a 
relatively small colony by the computer-based system, i.e. scored at a t-value of -7.0 or 
less, and those that were scored repeatedly by visual inspection. The biased set included 
double mutants that were either scored above a t-value of -7.0 or scored only once by 
visual inspection but were also related functionally to multiple genes within the unbiased 
set.  To represent gene function, we assigned each gene a GO functional annotation from 
a defined subset (Table S8). The putative synthetic genetic interactions were confirmed 
by random spore and/or tetrad analysis.  Sporulated cultures from SGA screens were 
stored at 4oC for the confirmation.  Tetrad dissections were carried out on synthetic 
dextrose (SD/MSG) complete medium.  We dissected tetrads for interactions that 
appeared to be inconclusive in the random spore assay.   

SGA Analysis: Media 
The media used in the SGA analysis were described previously (S1). Because 
ammonium sulfate impedes the function of G418 and clonNAT, synthetic medium 
containing these antibiotics was made with monosodium glutamic acid (MSG) as a 
nitrogen source; for selection of MATa meiotic progeny, the medium lacked histidine 
(selects for expression of MFA1pr-HIS3) and contained canavanine (selects for can1
